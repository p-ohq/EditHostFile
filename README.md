# EditHostFile
This is a simple batch program for adding host lines to you host file in Windows.
Copy the folder HostEditScript to your root c:\ 
Navigate to the folder and run EditHostFile\install.bat

You can then run these commands:  

- addHostLine

- ahl

If you have a custom host file that you want to use as default, you can copy that file to HostEditScript/Script and overwrite the host file there.
